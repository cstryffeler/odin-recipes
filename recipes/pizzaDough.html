    <h3>Decription</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe is very simple and only includes six ingredients! As you make this over and over, 
        you will start to get a feel for the texture and consistency of the dough and eventually will not
        need to pay too close of attention to the measurement of ingedients.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/2 cups of bread flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups of warm water (110F)</li>
            <li>2 TSP of active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 TSP of sugar</li>
            <li>1 TSP of salt</li>
            <li>2 TBSP of olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the bread flour, salt, and suger in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add yeast to 2 TSBP of warm water, wait until dissolved and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Add yeast mixture, olive oil, and most of the warm water to dry ingredients. Mix together with a wooden spoon until dough is shaggy.</li>
            <li>Turn dough onto a work bench and knead the dough, turning 90 degrees for every fold, for about 7-10 minutes. If the dough is tacky add more bread flour 1 TBSP at a time, if the dough is tough and hard to work, add water 1 TSP at a time.</li>
            <li>Take 2 TBSP of olive oil and coat the outside of the dough ball. Let rest, covered in a warm place, for about 1-2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 2-3 sections and roll out each to the desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Add toppings to your dough before baking. Bake pizza for 8-10 mins in a 450F prepped oven. I prefer to cook on cast iron, but a pizza stone or even baking sheet would suffice.</li>
            <li>Let cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
